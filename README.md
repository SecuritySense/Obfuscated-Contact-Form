# Obfuscated-Contact-Form

This code implements a contact form in Javascript which utilises Formspree and the inclusion of an obfuscated email address using the Email obfuscator script v2.1 by Tim Williams, University of Arizona.

To create the obfuscated email code visit http://www.jottings.com/obfuscator/ and enter your email address and copy the code between the `<!--` and `//-->` tags into the ```Main-Javascript``` code.

Once implemented on your web site submit a message via the form and as this is the first submission you will be asked to confirm your email address by Formspree.

The Formspree service is free and details can be found at https://formspree.io/
